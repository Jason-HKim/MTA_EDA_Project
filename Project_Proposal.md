## MTA EDA Project Proposal

#### Question/need:
What are the times/months/days with the least traffic to the highest traffic areas?
* least & most congested travel on the train
  - Check turnstile swipe numbers at specific locations or across all train stations
  - Check average train use across years to get a general trend/idea of least/most congested periods of time
  - Find highest traffic stops across the city to expand company scope

#### Data Description:
* MTA dataset
* Average total turnstile daily turnstile swipe ins/outs in MTA dataset for set stops

#### Tools:
* Use sql & DB Browser to clean & explore datasets
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Pandas dataframes

#### MVP Goal:
* Find lowest congestion times/days at stations with highest average ridership
