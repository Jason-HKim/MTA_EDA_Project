## MTA EDA Project Proposal

#### Question/need:
A high-speed delivery company, named Swift & Secure, that transports valuable items via the NYC subway wants to know what train stations are the most highly utilized in the city. However, due to the nature of their trade, they would like to use those stations at the times of lowest possible congestion. Furthemore, S&S would like to open transport facilities near those stations to help facilitate faster deliveries.

* What stations have the highest utilization across New York during holiday months (November, December, January)?
  - What days/times/weeks during these months are these stations the least congested?
  - Find the stations with the highest average turnstile activity.
  - Find the times and days at those stops with the lowest average turnstile activity.
  - Find the best times for the company to transport goods to these stations.

#### Data Description:
* MTA dataset
* Average total turnstile daily turnstile swipe ins/outs in MTA dataset for set stops
* US Census data on area-specific population density, and other potential resources

#### Tools:
* Use sql & DB Browser to clean & explore datasets
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Pandas dataframes

#### MVP Goal:
* Visualize the most popular stations across NYC, and areas with high population density to help provide S&S with the best locations to set up facilities and stations to utilize.
